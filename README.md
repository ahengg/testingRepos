```Python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Example data loading and processing (replace with actual data processing)
data = pd.read_csv('data.csv')
male_customers = data[data['gender'] == 'Male']
country_counts = male_customers['country'].value_counts()

# Plotting
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
country_counts.plot(kind='bar')
plt.title('Number of Male Customers by Country')
plt.xlabel('Country')
plt.ylabel('Number of Male Customers')
plt.show()
